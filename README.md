# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## About the Project

This repository is dedicated to providing comprehensive solutions and explanations for various Data Structures and Algorithms problems. It aims to be a resource for learners, educators, and developers seeking to enhance their understanding of these fundamental computer science concepts.

### Topics Covered

- **Basic Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs
- **Algorithms**: Sorting (Bubble, Merge, Quick), Searching (Binary, Linear), Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms
- **Advanced Topics**: Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's, Kruskal's), Tree Algorithms (BST operations, AVL Trees)
- **Problem Solving**: Solutions to classic DSA problems and challenges from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.

## Getting Started
